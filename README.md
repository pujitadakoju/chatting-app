This project is essentially a custom-built **Personal Chat Dashboard** that I designed to combine a user profile with an active messaging interface. The goal was to create a clean, intuitive space where a user can manage their identity and conversations simultaneously.

### **Core Features**

* **User Profile & Navigation**: On the left, there is a dedicated profile section for "Pujita Dakoju" which includes a status update ("~Go Ahead") and a profile picture.
* **Conversation Hub**: I built in a dropdown menu that tracks active chats. It currently shows three contacts—Shalini, Kavya, and Neha—complete with notification badges and their individual avatars for quick recognition.
* **Dynamic Chat Flow**: The main window uses a classic chat layout.
* **Incoming texts** are on the left in a light grey bubble.
* **Outgoing texts** are on the right in a signature green bubble.
* I also added **status logs** to track call durations, which helps give the chat a "history" feel.


* **Interactive Input**: At the bottom, there is a functional message bar where you can type out a response and hit "Send".

### **The Technical Side**

I used **Bootstrap 5** to handle the heavy lifting for the layout and the dropdown functionality. For the custom look and feel—like the circular profile pictures, the specific chat bubble colors, and the sleek scrollbar—I wrote custom **CSS3**. I also pulled in **Font Awesome** for the icons to keep the UI looking modern.

**Since the "Send" button is currently just a placeholder, would you like me to show you the JavaScript to make it actually post messages to the screen?**
